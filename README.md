# Analyzing the Impact of Lifestyle Factors on Sleep Quality and Duration In Support of SDG 3: Good Health & Well-being
## [Introduction](Introduction)
In a world where work demands, physical inactivity, and high stress are the norm, how much do our daily choices affect the quality and length of our sleep? 
Half of the world's population report struggling with sleep due to lifestyle factors like stress, occupation demands, or even weight. Poor sleep affects us all, 
yet we often overlook the powerful influence our daily habits have on it.
Our project, “Analyzing the Impact of lifestyle Factors on Sleep Quality and Duration,” aims to explore how elements such as physical activity, occupation type, Body Mass Index (BMI),
and stress levels influence both the quality and duration of sleep. The insights drawn from this data-driven analysis 
will illuminate the often-hidden impact of our lifestyles on this critical component of health.
Good sleep is fundamental to health and well-being, making this study a valuable resource for individuals and policymakers alike in understanding how healthier lifestyle choices can lead to better sleep.
This project aligns with SDG Goal 3 – Good Health and Well-being, as it highlights how informed lifestyle adjustments can enhance sleep quality, supporting overall health and public well-being.

## Conclusion
-  High-stress roles, like Sales Representatives, show poorer sleep and health metrics, while roles like Engineering report better sleep quality.
-  Higher stress levels correlate with lower sleep quality, reinforcing the need for stress management in demanding jobs.
-  More active individuals generally have better sleep and healthier BMI. Sedentary roles could benefit from programs encouraging movement.
-  Elevated blood pressure is associated with poorer sleep, emphasizing the need for cardiovascular monitoring in high-risk occupations.
-  Older adults and females report slightly better sleep quality, suggesting tailored wellness programs can improve outcomes.
-  Sleep issues vary by occupation, with high-stress roles facing greater risks, highlighting the need for workplace support.
This analysis summarily highlights the importance of targeted health interventions to improve sleep and well-being, tailored to the unique needs of each occupation. Addressing these lifestyle factors can lead to healthier, more productive workforces and support SDG Goal 3 – Good Health and Well-being.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made: 
-  For occupations with lower physical activity (e.g., sales representatives), encourage daily exercise routines to improve sleep quality, standing desks or walking breaks, which will help integrate more movement into the day, supporting better physical health and sleep outcomes.
-  Implementing stress-relieving programs, such as mindfulness sessions or counseling, to support employees in managing stress, can in turn, positively impact both sleep duration and quality, particularly in high-stress professions.
-  For individuals at risk of sleep disorders, like insomnia or sleep apnea, provide sleep hygiene workshops to educate them on best practices for a restful night’s sleep. Where needed, recommend consultations with healthcare providers for professional support, to enhance sleep quality and overall health.
-  Regular health checks, focusing on metrics like blood pressure and BMI, are essential, especially for those in high-stress or sedentary jobs. Monitoring these metrics helps identify early signs of sleep-related health issues, allowing for timely interventions that can improve sleep and general well-being.
-  Develop personalized health and wellness plans tailored to each occupation to boost physical activity, manage stress, and promote healthy sleep practices, ensuring each occupational group receives support relevant to its unique lifestyle challenges.
These recommendations aim to boost healthier lifestyle choices, improve sleep quality, and enhance well-being across various occupational groups, aligning with SDG Goal 3 – Good Health and Well-being.
